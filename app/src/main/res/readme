Cassie's Useless Fun Facts App

HOW TO PLAY
Fire up the app, and you will find yourself on the menu screen with 3 possible quiz options. Choose
one of the three topics to start, and you will be taken to the quiz page. Once you are on the quiz
page, you will not be able to leave until all questions are answered. No Cheating ;)

Once all 3 categories are completed, a surprise image will display and a message will pop up of your
score. The game will then be reset to play again with the image staying until you select a quiz.

Make a mistake? Once you are back on the main menu, after opening one of the quizes, a reset button
will appear. This will revert all inputted solutions and scores. You can start from scratch then.

Having issues selecting a quiz? The button may be disabled because you have already finished that
quiz. If you would like to try it again, hit the grey reset button in the top right.
